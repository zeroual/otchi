This is a guide to contributing to otchi

## Step 1 : Set up a working copy on your computer

Firstly you need a local fork of the the project, so go ahead and press the "fork" button in GitHub.
This will create a copy of the repository in your own GitHub account and you'll see a note that it's been forked.

## Step 2 : Do some work

This is the fun bit where you get to contribute to the project. It's usually best to start by fixing a bug that is either
 annoying you or you've found on the project's issue tracker.

Branch!

The number one rule is to put each piece of work on its own branch.
The general rule is that if you are bug fixing, then branch from master and if you are adding a new feature then branch from develop.

## Step 3 : Create the PR

To create a PR you need to push your branch to the origin remote and then press some buttons on GitHub (create pull request).

## Step 4 : Review by the maintainers

For your work to be integrated into the project, the maintainers will review your work and either request changes or merge it.
